# roster-creator
Quick data entry for rosters and roster management using Excel VBA.

These macros were originally developed for a private client on the Airtasker platform.

The scope of the task was to create a system which allowed for easy data entry of hire events for the business which created a consistent and visually distinctive. This version of the code runs without fault for the specific needs of this client.

## Using this code

To run a full version of this code and explore how it works, I recommend downloading the version of the workbook with all components already intalled and clicking the button. All operations are self-explanatory.

## Version notes

### v0.1
The initial release is a cleaned version of the code supplied to the client.

## Future development
The intent of this project is to further develop it into a stand-alone roster creation system. Further revisions will be more general in nature and allow users to create rosters according to their own needs.
